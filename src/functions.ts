// In JS if a func doesn't return anything, it'll return undefined by default, but 'undefined' is also a type in TS (but rarely used), so if we need to explicitly return the type 'undefined' by a function we should also explicitly return nothing at the end of it, otherwise we're gonna get an error that the func should return a value.
