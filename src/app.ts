// ============== General Info About Decorators ==================
/**
 * When to use "decorators"? Some cases are...
 *  - Before/After hooks.
 *  - Watch property changes and method calls.
 *  - Transform parameters.
 *  - Add extra methods or properties.
 *  - Runtime type validation.
 *  - Auto serialization and deserialization.
 *  - Dependency Injection.
 *
 * Popular frameworks like Angular and Nest use decorators a lot.
 *
 * To be able to use "decorators" we first need to set the 2 options
 * in the tsconfig file, "target: ES6" and "experimentalDecorators:
 * true", because at this moment decorators are a stage 2 proposal for
 * JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of
 * TypeScript.
 *
 * Decorators in general are related to classes and its members and in
 * the the end they're basically functions.
 *
 * There are five types of decorators we can use: Class Decorators,
 * Property Decorators, Method Decorators, Accessor Decorators,
 * Parameter Decorators.
 *
 * Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a
 * meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.
 *
 * Applying decorators is a lot like composing a chain of
 * functions, pretty much like higher-order function or class. With
 * decorators, we can easily implement proxy pattern to reduce our
 * code and do some cool things.
 *
 * Decorators are "executed only once" when a class is defined and
 * not when it is instantiated, so we don't even need to instantiate a
 * class to have a decorator being executed.
 *
 * The evaluation order of different types of decorators is well-defined:
 *  1) Parameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property
 * Decorators are applied for each instance member.
 *  2) Parameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property
 * Decorators are applied for each static member.
 *  3) Parameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.
 *  4) Class Decorators are applied for the class.
 *
 * We can apply multiple decorators to a single target. The evaluation
 * order of the decorators composed is:
 *  1) Outer Decorator Evaluate.
 *  2) Inner Decorator Evaluate.
 *  3) Inner Decorator Call.
 *  4) Outer Decorator Call.

// ============== Class Decorator ==================
/**
 * This function is a "class decorator", it's not necessarily a
 * convention, but it's common to see the name of the decorators
 * starting with a capital letter.
 */
function Logger(constructor: Function) {
  console.log("Logging...");
  console.log(constructor);
}

/**
 * Here we're using the "class decorator", the "@" symbol is an
 * special identifier that TS recognizes and directly in front of it
 * we should point to a function (the decorator) without the "()";
 *
 * Except for the "parameter decorator", we must ALWAYS use decorators right above
 * the name of the "member" (class, property, method, accessor) we want to
 * use it on.
 */

class Person {
  firstName = "Clayton";

const person1 = new Person();

/**
 * The decorator's message and the class itself will be logged first,
 * then the constructor's message and only then the instance of the
 * class.
 */
console.log(person1);

// ============== Decorator Factory ==================
/**
 * A decorator factory returns a decorator function, but it allows us
 * to configure it when we assign it as a decorator to something.
 *
 * Now we can have a parameter in the decorator and pass to it the
 * message to log when we call it on the class.

 * We need to execute (use the parenthesis) it as a regular
 * function in this case, then the "outer" function "LoggerFactory"
 * will return the attached value (wich is another function) as the
 * decorator to this class.
 *
 * The advantage is that now we can and pass in arguments to be used
 * in the returned "inner" decorator function.

 * The decorator bellow is an example of "meta programming", because
 * we're creating a decorator (tool) that could be exposed for other
 * developers to use by adding it to a class, otherwise it would do
 * nothing and that is what some frameworks do (in a more elaborated
 * way ofc).
 */

  /**
   * The parameter "underscore" means that we know we'll receive an
   * argument, but we won't need it, in this case we have to specify

   * TS would complain about declaring a variable not using it later.

// ============== Property Decorator ==================
/**
 * When we add a decorator to a property, the decorator receive 2
 * arguments (target and propertyName, but they don't need to have
 * these names), if we use a decorator on an instance property
 * the target will be the "prototype" of the object that was created
 * and if we had a "static" property then target would refer to the

// ============== Accessor (get/set) Decorator ==================

 * arguments (target, name and descriptor), if we use the decorator
 * on an instance property the "target" will be the "prototype" of
 * the object that was created and if we had a "static" property
 * then target would refer to the "constructor" function instead,
 * the "name" refers to the name of the accessor and the descriptor
 * refers to the "property descriptor" of the member in which the
 * decorator was applied to.
 *
 * Here we also used a special TS type for the desciptor.

// ============== Method Decorator ==================

 * do, just the "descriptor" is a bit different, since it's a method and not an
 * accessor.

   * separately.

   * Descriptor for the member.
