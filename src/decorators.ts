// ================ General Info About Decorators =================
/**
 * The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows
 * you to dynamically add new behavior to objects. It does so by
 * wrapping them in special objects (functions in TS) called
 * decorators, which contain the added behavior. This is an
 * alternative to inheritance.
 *
 * The Decorator pattern is useful when you want to add behavior to
 * individual objects, rather than to an entire class of objects. It
 * is also useful when you want to add behavior without affecting the
 * existing hierarchy, or when you want to add behavior that can be
 * changed dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * When to use "decorators"? Some cases are...
 *  - Before/After hooks.
 *  - Watch property changes and method calls.
 *  - Transform parameters.
 *  - Add extra methods or properties.
 *  - Runtime type validation.
 *  - Auto serialization and deserialization.
 *  - Dependency Injection.
 *
 * Popular frameworks like Angular and Nest use decorators a lot.
 *
 * To be able to use "decorators" we first need to set the 2 options
 * in the tsconfig file, "target: ES6" and "experimentalDecorators:
 * true", because at this moment decorators are a stage 2 proposal for
 * JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of
 * TypeScript.
 *
 * Decorators in general are related to classes and its members and in
 * the the end they're basically functions.
 *
 * There are five types of decorators we can use:
 *  - Class Decorators,
 *  - Property Decorators,
 *  - Method Decorators,
 *  - Accessor Decorators,
 *  - Parameter Decorators.
 *
 * Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a
 * meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.
 *
 * Applying decorators is a lot like composing a chain of
 * functions, pretty much like higher-order function or class. With
 * decorators, we can easily implement proxy pattern to reduce our
 * code and do some cool things.
 *
 * Decorators are "executed only once" when a class is defined and
 * not when it is instantiated, so we don't even need to instantiate a
 * class to have a decorator being executed.
 *
 * The evaluation order of different types of decorators is
 * well-defined:
 *  1) Parameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property
 * Decorators are applied for each instance member.
 *  2) Parameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property
 * Decorators are applied for each static member.
 *  3) Parameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.
 *  4) Class Decorators are applied for the class.
 *
 * We can apply multiple decorators to a single target. The evaluation
 * order of the decorators composed is:
 *  1) Outer Decorator Evaluate.
 *  2) Inner Decorator Evaluate.
 *  3) Inner Decorator Call.
 *  4) Outer Decorator Call.

 * This function is a "class decorator", it's not necessarily a
 * convention, but it's common to see the name of the decorators

 * special identifier that TS recognizes and directly in front of it
 * we should point to a function (the decorator) without the "()";
 *
 * Except for the "parameter decorator", we must ALWAYS use decorators
 * right above the name of the "member" (class, property, method,
 * accessor) we want to use it on.
